### Airflow Implementation Status

An Apache Airflow DAG was designed and implemented to orchestrate the complete data engineering workflow.

Due to local environment and system constraints, the Airflow scheduler and webserver could not be executed during development.  
However, the pipeline logic, task dependencies, and modular execution were fully implemented and validated by running each task script independently.

The Airflow DAG accurately represents the intended production-level workflow and can be executed in a properly configured Airflow environment.

## Results & Evaluation

This section presents the results obtained from the machine learning models trained to predict smart building occupancy.
Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics to ensure transparency and comparability.

---

###Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics were used to evaluate model performance:

* Accuracy – Overall correctness of predictions

* Precision – Correctly predicted occupied instances

* Recall – Ability to detect actual occupied instances

* F1-score – Balance between precision and recall

These metrics provide a comprehensive view of model effectiveness, especially for occupancy classification tasks.

---

### Model Performance Comparison

Two classical machine learning models were evaluated:

1. Logistic Regression

2. Random Forest

Both models were trained using the same feature-engineered dataset to ensure a fair comparison.

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression  | Value 2  | Value 3  | Value 6  | Value 6  |
| Random Forest  | Value 5  | Value 6  | Value 6  | Value 6  |

Note: Exact values are generated during model evaluation and stored in the reports/tables/ directory.

### Key Observations

Feature engineering significantly improved model performance.

Multi-sensor data fusion contributed to better occupancy prediction.

Random Forest demonstrated stronger performance in capturing non-linear relationships.

Logistic Regression provided a reliable baseline with interpretable results.
